# Record Management System

## Description
A file-based system to manage records (like library books), with add/search/edit/delete functionality (C++, mysql).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install required packages if necessary.

Keep in mind that the code must be written in OOP.

## Tasks
- Plan system: What type of record? (e.g., Book: ID, title, author, year). Design struct and menu.
- Implement basic menu-driven system using CLI. Create `addRecord()` to write to file.
- Implement `displayAllRecords()` that reads from file and lists all records.
- Implement `searchRecordByID()` function. Handle not found case.
- Refactor code. Improve modularity. Start implementing `deleteRecord()`.
- Implement `updateRecord()` function. User selects ID, edits record in-place.
- Implement sorting (e.g., by title or year).
- Add export to CSV format.
- Add basic error handling and input validation.
- Final testing. Create README with instructions and screenshots. Submit as Git repo.
